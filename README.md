# Hi, I’m Deanna 👋

#### Software Engineer | Data Practitioner | Applied AI | Digital Health Systems | Biomedical Data

I’m a machine-learning–oriented engineer working across data workflows, reproducible experimentation pipelines, backend services, and cloud-aligned development. My background in biomedical science, neuroscience research, and computing gives me a strong foundation for building reliable, privacy-conscious systems in health and research contexts.

I’ve worked with EEG, behavioural, and psychophysics datasets, timing-sensitive acquisition workflows, and structured ML pipelines, while also building backend components, ingestion pipelines, containerised environments, and early applied-AI prototypes.

🏆 Winner – NextGenAI Hackathon (2025)
Contributed backend logic, data handling, workflow reliability features, and early scheduling functionality for a voice-assistive healthcare prototype delivered in 7 days.

🏆 Winner – eSafety Hackathon Mini Challenge (2025)
Contributor to the winning Mini Challenge team for MLAI’s Needle in the Hashtag Hackathon, designing and training a hybrid DistilBERT-based multilabel classifier that identifies high-risk online personas by combining text embeddings with linguistic and network features, in two days.

I enjoy the intersection where data → modelling → engineering → real world context meet, creating systems that are robust, explainable, and useful to real users.

# 📁 Where to Find My Work

**👉 [Portfolio Organisation (WIP)](https://github.com/deannaspinks)**

I set this up so I could integrate my GitHub repos with Linear. Aiming for this to be the home of more polished, documented projects.

**👉 This GitHub Account**

Explorations, prototypes, and learning repositories.

Some applied-AI and ML projects aren't in my GitHub yet - feel free to ask about in-progress work.
