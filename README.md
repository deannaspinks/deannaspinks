Hi, I’m Deanna 👋

ML & Cloud Engineer | Biomedical Data | Applied AI | Digital Health Systems

I’m a machine-learning–oriented engineer working across data workflows, reproducible experimentation pipelines, backend services, and cloud-aligned development. My background in biomedical science, neuroscience research, and computing gives me a strong foundation for building reliable, privacy-conscious systems in health and research contexts.

I’ve worked with EEG, behavioural, and psychophysics datasets, timing-sensitive acquisition workflows, and structured ML pipelines—while also building backend components, ingestion pipelines, containerised environments, and early applied-AI prototypes.

🏆 Winner – NextGenAI Hackathon (2025)
Contributed backend logic, data handling, workflow reliability features, and early scheduling functionality for a voice-assistive healthcare prototype delivered in 7 days.

I enjoy the intersection where data → modelling → engineering → clinical context meet, creating systems that are robust, explainable, and useful to real users.

📁 Where to Find My Work

👉 [Portfolio Organisation (WIP)](https://github.com/deannaspinks)

I set this up so I could integrate my GitHub repos with Linear. Aiming for this to be the home of more polished, documented projects.

👉 This GitHub Account

Explorations, prototypes, and learning repositories.

Some applied-AI and ML projects are still being migrated into structured form and aren't in my GitHub - feel free to ask about in-progress work.
