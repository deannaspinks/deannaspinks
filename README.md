# Hi, I'm Deanna 👋 

#### Software Engineer | Building adaptable and robust cloud, edge and AI systems for healthcare innovation

I’m a software engineer with a background in biomedical science, physiology, and neuroscience. My experience spans lab management, quality systems and emergency management, giving me the ability to bridge software engineering with real-world clinical and operational environments.

I apply this multidisciplinary foundation to build reliable, data-driven healthcare and research solutions.

A jack of all trades, I translate vague ideas into full-fledged features with minimal direction. I have experience facilitating Agile delivery as Scrum Master for a university capstone project and project management experience in government and research contexts.

I work across data, backend, infrastructure, and user-facing interfaces. I design cohesive systems with adaptability, reliability, usability and compliance in mind.
